## Review

### Problems

My mind finds it difficult to work with clojure and the immutability of variables.

Finding my instinct is to start by seeing if the item will divide by another prime (eg 2), and if it does add the prime to a list and recursively go through until you're left with a prime.

With clojure, I struggled with how to add to do this in a nice way.
