# Prime factors Kata

## Origin

This kata came from [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) by Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob). This is one of the examples he mentions multiple times in the book as a good practicing tool.

## Problem

The problem to solve, is to find the prime numbers that multiply together to get the original number.

### Prime numbers
