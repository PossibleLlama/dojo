# Dojo

## Aim

This is to practice coding and get used to languages/ide specific features over the problems themselves.

## Origins

For each kata, I have tried to give credit to where the problem came from.

This is heavily influenced by Robert C Martin, aka Uncle Bob.
Several of the problems have come from what he has written about in various books.
I have also got several of the kata's from the [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/) website.
More recently these problems have come from [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) as a nice set of fairly quick puzzles.

## Setup

For each kata, there is an explanation of what the problem is, any rules governing the problem and example inputs/outputs.

Within each kata's folder, there will be a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format specifying when it was completed, and the source to go along with it. This will let me quickly see when they were completed, and track progress of solutions.
