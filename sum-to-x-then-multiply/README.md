# Sum to x then multiple Kata

## Origin

This came from [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) 2020, as day 1's first challenge.

## Problem

You have a given input file, each line is a single number.
You must find which pair of numbers add together to get the given value (in the original 2020), and the multiply them together to give a single output value.

For example, with the given input:

``` text
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

The two numbers `1721` and `299` add together to get 2020.
The multiplying these together gives `514579` as the final answer.
