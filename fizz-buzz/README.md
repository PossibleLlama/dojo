# Bowling game Kata

## Origin

This kata I have seen in a lot of places, I believe I first heared about it at school. [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc) has a video regarding the kata, its also on [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/).

## Problem

I want to print out all the numbers between 1 and 100.

For a given number, if it is divisible by 3, the number should be replaced by the word `Fizz`.

For a given number, if it is divisible by 5, the number should be replaces by the word `Buzz`.

### Additional features

- The numbers between which you print can be changed.
- I want to specify a word to replace any number with. Eg. `"Bang" 7`

### Examples
