## Review

This hasn't completed the task, for instance there is no reading of a file here. It was a good chance to use GoLang again with more string manipulation than I have used before.

There was more that I had forgotten about the language than is ideal, but good to pick it up again quickly.

It was nice to refactor into small chunks of a function, each that do a small thing. Also to think about building it to be extensible in the future with additions in mind.
